                    “Circular economy is not just an option, it’s an urgent necessity,” stated Dounia Wone, one of the

                <p>In addition to talks, hands-on workshops allowed attendees to learn methodologies they could apply to
                    their own projects. These spaces encouraged collaboration among companies, institutions, and

                    The session, organized by Lúcid, EIG, and D!OS, aimed to share knowledge with manufacturing
                    companies and guide them in the mindset needed to embrace a conceptual shift in the way they design
                    and market their products.

                    The new action plan announces initiatives along the entire life cycle of products. It targets how
                    products are designed, promotes circular economy processes, encourages sustainable consumption, and
                    aims to ensure that waste is prevented and the resources used are kept in the EU economy for as long
                    as possible.
